This is a simple project that fulfills your curiosity to know which Jojo manga cover has Araki blessed you with. Pretty much straight forward, you type your birthday, then these bunch of scripts will search the closest japanese release volume from the [Jojo Bizarre Wiki Adventure](https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) and they will retrive to you your Jojo cover. And that's it, you can now live happily ever after.

With this project, I studied how create a Typescript project using Gatsby framework, better understanding how to use gatsby plugins and how to create GraphQL queries using Gatsby GraphQL API. I've also improved my web scraping knowledge (now using Cheerio framework) and studied how to proper translate a website. Even thought it was a small and simple project, I think I've learned a lot using Typescript by myself, from configurating to proper creating components, since my only previous experience with it was in online classes.

And besides, it was very fun to do. I'm very proud with the result and I know there are other Jojo fans who are silly as me and my friends that will have fun with this project too.

## Are you a Jojo's Bizarre Adventure fan and want to help me?

Then feel free to make any kind of pull request! I'd love to learn better practices with you. Also, if you notice some of the translations are *kind broken* or not properly translated, don't hesitate to contact me (sinayra@hotmail.com).
